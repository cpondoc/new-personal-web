One of the biggest takeaways I’ve had from the quarter is working without music. Some of my best “deep work” periods came when I deleted Spotify and worked in complete silence. This also rings true for when I just naturally do errands or go about my day.

Music is one of my greatest sources of creativity and allows me to unlock memories I didn’t know I still had in me. At the same time, though, it has this way of making me forget reality. When I’m incredibly stressed or need a break, listening to some tunes isn’t bad. At the same time, though, when I need to lock in and focus on what I want, poetic lyricism might need to be absent.
